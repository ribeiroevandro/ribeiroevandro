# Commit Message Conventions

All commits must follow the Conventional Commits format strictly:

- **Format:** `<type>[optional scope]: <description>`
- **Semantic types:**
  - `feat` (new feature, MINOR version bump)
  - `fix` (bug fix, PATCH version bump)
  - `docs` (documentation)
  - `style` (formatting)
  - `refactor` (code refactoring)
  - `perf` (performance improvement)
  - `test` (adding/refactoring tests)
  - `chore` (maintenance/build)
  - `ci` (CI/CD related changes)
- **Scope:** Use a scope (e.g., `login`, `notifications`, `payments`) to describe the part of the codebase affected, when applicable.
- **Breaking changes:** If a commit introduces a breaking change, add an exclamation mark (!) after the type/scope (e.g., `feat(auth)!: remove old login API`).
- **Description:** Keep descriptions concise, imperative, and in the present tense (e.g., `add`, `fix`, `refactor`).
- **One task per commit:** Each commit should represent a single task or change.
- **No AI/LLM co-authors:** Never add `Co-Authored-By:` for Cursor or any LLM in commits or PRs. The engineer is responsible for all code that enters the repository. Using an LLM as a tool is valid, but authorship stays with the human contributor.

## Overview
Generates a commit message following the Conventional Commits conventions.

## Rules Applied
- Format: `<type>[optional scope]: <description>`
- Breaking changes: add `!` after the type or after `type(scope)!` and explain the migration path in the commit body.
- **Never add `Co-Authored-By:`** for Cursor, GitHub Copilot, or any LLM in commits or PR descriptions. Ownership remains with the human engineer.
- When to separate commits:
  - Separate feature implementation from tests
  - Separate refactoring from behavior changes
  - Keep dependency updates isolated

## Instructions (command behavior)
1. Analyze the changes provided (diff, list of modified files, or description of changes) — whatever is passed to the command in the chat.
2. Generate ONLY the commit message, without additional explanations. The output should contain:
  - Header: `<type>[scope]: <description>`
3. When a breaking change occurs, include `!` in the header and explain the migration path in the body.
4. If the changes involve multiple logical types (e.g., feature + tests), it's preferable to suggest separate commits (a line in the body can suggest the split, e.g., "Split into: feat(...), test(...)" — but only generate the message for the requested commit).

## Output examples
- `feat(auth): add OAuth2 login support`
- `fix(api): handle null user responses`
- `refactor(db)!: migrate to PostgreSQL schema v2`
